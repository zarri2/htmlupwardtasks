    These tags define headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and other 
	elements that make up a web page. HTML also allows for the inclusion of other web 
	technologies, such as CsS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript, which can be used to add 
	styling and interactivity to a web page . </p>
